A simple collection of typescript logging tools using [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) - adds timestamps, colourization and will output your logs into a `logs` directory in the root of your project.
## Overview
This is a minimalist set of utilities that can be imported and used within a few seconds to get drastically better and more useful logs into you application as you build it - nothing more. You'll probably want to replace it down the line. This is just a convenience tool for hitting the ground running.

Using  the utilities herein to log in your application will save all of your logs to appropriately named files added to a `logs/` directory which will be created in the root of your project.
* info.log
* debug.log
* silly.log

All logs will be timestamped; the default locale is `en-GB` which can be changed.
Timestamps are just that, _time_ stamps. They do not include the date.
Logging in the terminal will have the log-level printed and colourized.
## Ready-Steady-Go
1. Install with one of these depending on your preferred package manager:
	* `npm install @developerjake/djlogger`
	* `yarn add @developerjake/djlogger`
2. Import what you need (see [examples](#example-usage)) and start using it.
## Configuration
Everything works just fine out of the box. These conflagration options are all optional.
### Set  the logging level (Optional)
* Use a variable in a `.env` file  in the root of your project
* If not set, logging level defaults to `debug`
```
LOG_LEVEL=silly
```
Options are `info`, `debug`, and `silly`.
### Change your locale (Optional)
The locale defaults to `en-GB`. If you want a different once, [see this example](#logger-instance-with-custom-configuration) on how to set it.
### Keep old logs (Optional)
By default, each time you restart your app, the old log files are nuked. Why? Well, because that's my preference. Change it easily - [see this example](#logger-instance-with-custom-configuration).

## Public API
#### Get a logger instance
*  `logger`
*  `getLogger(wipePreviousLogs=true, locale='en-GB')`
#### Overwrite the NodeJS Console
*  `overWriteConsole(wipePreviousLogs=true, locale='en-GB')`
#### Individual logging methods
*  `log`
*  `info`
*  `debug`
*  `silly`
*  `warn`
*  `error`
*  `table`

## Example Usage
### Set  the logging level
* Use a variable in a `.env` file  in the root of your project
* If not set, logging level defaults to `debug`
```JSON
LOG_LEVEL=silly
```
### Default-config logger
```typescript
import { logger } from 'djlogger';

logger.info('Frontend? ü§î Backend? üôÑ Weekend? üòÅ');
```
### Logger instance with custom configuration
```typescript
import { getLogger } from 'djlogger';

const wipePreviousLogs = false;
const locale = 'de-DE';
const logger = getLogger(wipePreviousLogs, locale);

logger.warn('warning‚ùó'); // 07:44:12 warn: warning‚ùó
```
### Overwrite the NodeJS Console logging methods
```typescript
import { overwriteConsole } from 'djlogger';

overWriteConsole(undefined, 'ja-JP-u-ca-japanese');

console.log('üîí locked'); // 14:26:33 info: üîí locked
```
### Individual logging level methods
```typescript
import { table, error, debug } from 'djlogger';

const stuff = [
  ['BTC', 'amazing'],
  ['ETH', 'defi-tacular'],
  ['DOGE', 'meme-trash']
];

try {
  table(stuff);
} catch (e: Error) {
  error(`üí• Ka-blamo`, e.message);
  debug(e.stack);
}
```
